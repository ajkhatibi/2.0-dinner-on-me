# 2.0-dinner-on-me

redoing a previous project a colleageu and I made. We are rebuilding it so that it emcompasses newer technologies like react. The first version of the project did not ultilize a full MVC model. This version will however. The project allows any user to find something to eat at any given momemt. It's supposed to be helpful in situations like a relationship when no one knows what to eat. The technologies included are: 
1. node
2. express
3. react
4. mongodb

This project is in the begining stages. It's inital phase as begin and we expect its second phase (all components working) will be done in two weeks time. The stages of completion will go as follows. 
1. inital setup of code (done)
2. all components working
3. designs of react bootstrap have been implemented
4. yelp api works correctly 
5. google maps api works correctly
6. the whole one page app is reactive (completion)
